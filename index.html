    <h1>Cloud Linux for Chrome</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>ChromeOS is getting increasingly more powerful, and for many
    users, it can already do most of their everyday tasks. But on
    occasion, it is convenient to have access to a full Linux desktop
    environment. If you remembered to leave your PC running, you can
    always connect to it
    with <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp">Chrome
    Remote Desktop</a>, but what do you do if you don't have a PC or
    it you don't normally leave it powered on? Wouldn't it be useful
    to have a virtual server that can be reached from anywhere on the
    internet?</p>

    <h2>Getting a virtual server</h2>

    <p>Many users, even if they don't have an "always-on" Linux
    desktop, do have at least temporary access to a PC. And that's a
    great choice for executing the commands in this tutorial. But
    thanks to the magic
    of <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux">Termux</a>,
    all you really need is your ChromeOS device. You might consider
    installing
    an <a href="https://github.com/Neo-Oli/termux-ubuntu">Ubuntu
    chroot</a> though, as it gives access to more command line
    utilities than plain Termux does.</p>

    <p>Before you can do anything, you obviously have to get a virtual
    Linux machine. You can <a href="https://amazonlightsail.com/">cheaply rent</a> one
    from a multitude of different hosting providers. But for the
    purposes of this tutorial, we'll configure
    an <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/">LXD</a> container
    instance instead.</p>

    <p>You do not necessarily need to perform these steps, if you
    already have access to a (virtual) machine that you want to use,
    and if you don't want to run LXD to further partition that
    server.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, since LXD
    is <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/">available</a>
    for many different distributions. You can follow this tutorial and
    install an Ubuntu container, even if the host runs a different
    Linux distribution. Note, these days it is strongly recommended to
    install LXD in the form of
    a <a href="https://linuxcontainers.org/lxd/getting-started-cli/">snap</a>
    package, if possible.</p>

    <p>These commands must be executed on the server that is going to
    host your container.</p>

    <pre><code>sudo snap install lxd
sudo lxd init

lxc launch ubuntu:16.04 <b>cloud-linux</b></code></pre>

    <h2>Configuring the virtual server</h2>

    <p>For the rest of this tutorial, we'll use <code>lxc
    exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- ...</code> to run commands inside of
    our container. Of course, if you have a different type of virtual
    environment, <code>ssh</code> might the appropriate command
    instead.</p>

    <p>Also, LXD defaults to creating an <code><b>ubuntu</b></code> user in
    addition to <code><b>root</b></code>. This user can
    use <code>sudo</code> to gain elevated privileges without having
    to enter another password. If your virtual machine is configured
    differently, you might need to make adjustments.</p>

    <h2>Temporary VNC access</h2>

    <p>In order to be able to turn on Chrome Remote Desktop, we already
    need a working X Windows desktop environment that runs inside of
    the container. While this sounds like
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catch-22#Concept">Catch
    22</a>, there fortunately are ways to temporarily give us a
    working X Windows environment.</p>

    <p>We install the <a href="http://xfce.org">XFCE desktop
    environment</a>, as its default configuration doesn't have any
    expensive graphical effects. This works better over slow internet
    links. But you can always substitute your favorite desktop
    environment instead, if your network is fast enough:</p>

    <pre><code>lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- apt-get update
lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- apt-get -y dist-upgrade

lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- \
    apt-get -y install xfce4 vnc4server \
                       chromium-browser gnome-keyring

lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- sudo -iu <b>ubuntu</b> mkdir -p /home/<b>ubuntu</b>/.vnc
lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- \
    sudo -iu <b>ubuntu</b> ln -s /bin/true /home/<b>ubuntu</b>/.vnc/xstartup

lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- sudo -iu <b>ubuntu</b> vncserver
<i>You will require a password to access your desktops.
Password: <b>Pick any arbitrary password here</b>
Verify:   <b>&hellip;</b>
Would you like to enter a view-only password (y/n)? n
xauth:  file /home/<b>ubuntu</b>/.Xauthority does not exist
New 'X' desktop is cloud-linux:1
Creating default startup script /home/<b>ubuntu</b>/.vnc/xstartup
Starting applications specified in /home/<b>ubuntu</b>/.vnc/xstartup
Log file is /home/<b>ubuntu</b>/.vnc/cloud-linux:1.log</i>

lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- env DISPLAY=:1 \
    sudo -iu <b>ubuntu</b> /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc</code></pre>

    <h2>Tunneling VNC</h2>

    <p>The next step depends a lot on your choice of virtual container
    environment. If there is no firewall between you and services
    running inside your container, then you don't have to do anything
    special at this point.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, if you can only contact your container
    through the <code>lxc</code> command, then you should forward the
    port that is used by VNC:</p>

    <pre><code>lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- apt-get -y install netcat

nc -l -p 5901 -c 'lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- \
                  su -c "nc 127.0.0.1 5901" <b>ubuntu</b>'</code></pre>

    <p>On the other hand, if you access your virtual machine through
    <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/ssh">SSH</a>, you might want to
    try something along these lines instead:

    <pre><code>ssh -L 5901:127.0.0.1:5901 -N <b>cloud-linux</b></code></pre>

    <p>You should now be able to connect to your container from
    any <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.realvnc.viewer.android">VNC
    Client</a>. Simply tell it to establish a connection
    to <code>localhost</code> on port <code>5901</code>. Please note
    that this is not the default port (that would be <code>5900</code>). When
    prompted, enter the VNC password that you picked earlier.</p>

    <h2>Installing Google Chrome&hellip;</h2>

    <p>In your newly-configured virtual Linux environment, open the
    Chromium browser by finding it in the application menu (most likely
    located in the top left-hand corner). Go
    to <code>https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/</code> and
    download the Chrome installer for Ubuntu 64bit. You can now close
    Chromium.</p>

    <p>Open a terminal window and type the following commands; when
    you install Chrome with <code>dpkg -i</code>, there might be an
    error message, that you can safely ignore.</p>

    <pre><code>sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
sudo apt-get -y install -f</pre></code>

    <p>Open <code>Applications&#8614;Internet&#8614;Google
    Chrome</code>. Make sure that you are logged into your Google
    account in this browser. Then find
    the <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chrome-remote-desktop/gbchcmhmhahfdphkhkmpfmihenigjmpp">Chrome
    Remote Desktop</a> extension in the Web Store, and install
    it. Launch the newly installed </code>Chrome Remote Desktop</code> app.</p>

    <p>You'll have to click away a couple of informational messages
    until you see an option that reads <code>Remote Assistance:
    User-to-user screen sharing</code>. Select that option, then click
    on <code>Share this computer for another user to see and
    control</code>. Allow Chrome to download the Chrome Remote Desktop
    installer.</p>

    <p>Once the package has completed downloading, close all browser windows.</p>

    <h2>&hellip;and Friends</h2>

    <p>From within the terminal window, install the package that you
    just downloaded. At this point, we also make a couple of
    configuration changes that the installer forgets to do:</p>

    <pre><code>echo 'exec /etc/xdg/xfce4/xinitrc' \
     >/home/ubuntu/.chrome-remote-desktop-session
chmod 755 /home/ubuntu/.chrome-remote-desktop-session

echo 'export CHROME_REMOTE_DESKTOP_DEFAULT_DESKTOP_SIZES=3840x2560' |
  tee -a /home/ubuntu/.profile

sudo dpkg -i ~/Downloads/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb
<i>dpkg: dependency problems prevent configuration of chrome-remote-desktop:
 chrome-remote-desktop depends on xvfb-randr | xvfb; however:
  Package xvfb-randr is not installed.
  Package xvfb is not installed.
 chrome-remote-desktop depends on xbase-clients; however:
  Package xbase-clients is not installed.
 chrome-remote-desktop depends on python-psutil; however:
  Package python-psutil is not installed.
Errors were encountered while processing:
 chrome-remote-desktop</i>

sudo apt-get -y install -f
sudo adduser <b>ubuntu</b> chrome-remote-desktop</code></pre>

    <p>Launch <code>Applications&#8614;Chrome Apps&#8614;Chrome Remote
    Desktop</code>. If you see an item that reads <code>Access your
    computer from anywhere</code>, click on the <code>Get
    Started</code> button. This option sometimes doesn't show. That's
    OK. But in either case, click on <code>Enable remote
    connections</code> when you see it.</p>

    <p>You'll be prompted to pick a PIN for this computer. Pick
    something that you can remember. You'll need it each time you want
    to connect with a new Remote Desktop client.</p>

    <h2>Finishing up</h2>

    <p>Restart your container and try connecting to it with Chrome
    Remote Desktop. From this point forward, you no longer need
    VNC. So, let's clean up all temporarily used resources:</p>

    <pre><code>lxc restart <b>cloud-linux</b>

lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- \
    apt-get remove --purge -y vnc4server chromium-browser
lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- apt-get autoremove --purge -y
lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- apt-get clean

lxc exec <b>cloud-linux</b> -- rm -rf \
  /home/ubuntu/.vnc \
   /home/ubuntu/.config/chromium \
  /home/ubuntu/Downloads/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb \
  /home/ubuntu/Downloads/chrome-remote-desktop_current_amd64.deb</code></pre>

    Now you are all set, and if you feel like it, you can open a
    terminal window and install your favorite desktop applications:

    <pre><code>sudo apt-get -y install libreoffice
sudo apt-get clean</code></pre>
